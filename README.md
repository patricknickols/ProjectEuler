# ProjectEuler
Just the first few problems available at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) in a variety of languages. 

Note that Project Euler does not want solutions released publically for any more than the first 20 or so problems. For this reason I intend to write as optimal a solution as I can in any languages I know for those first twenty and then stop.
